The following conventions will be used for describing data structure element types:
Byte/Char One byte (8 bits)
"INT*2 2 byte, signed integer data"
"INT*4 4 byte, signed integer data"
"UINT*4 4 byte, unsigned integer data"
"REAL*4 4 byte, floating point data adhering to IEEE-754-1985"
standard
"String NULL (0) terminated array of ASCII coded characters,"
each character occupying 1 byte
Pointer Contains the address of a data item.  Size is
architecture dependent.
